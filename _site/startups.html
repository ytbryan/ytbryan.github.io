    <p>Startups &amp; Advices</p>

<p>Hi there, you have reached this page because someone passed you this link to get advice on your startups or traditional business.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know my profile, please see <a href="/profile">here</a></p>

<p>I give advices for new businesses especially software business.
These are the areas I’m interested:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much to charge</li>
  <li>Technical direction and project management</li>
  <li>How to survive the first 4 years of your new business</li>
  <li>Ruby, Rails, iOS and other softwares that you need for productivity</li>
  <li>How to hire in asia</li>
  <li>How to do onboarding on your webapp</li>
  <li>Introverts - how to survive talking to extroverts</li>
  <li>How to and where to get a lot of data to start off</li>
  <li>How to succeed before you even start your new business</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I value-add to your strategy and new business?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I can connect you to the right business person</li>
  <li>I can recommend a developer</li>
  <li>I can train your developers</li>
</ul>

<p>Expectation and how much should I charge?</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you receive this link and is a new business, there is no charges to engage me except that I hope to receive 0.5% as equity and be on your advisory board.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a request but this is an expectation. It is a fixed rate and over the years I stop taking more than 0.5 person.</p>

<p>What is an Advisory Board?</p>
<ul>
  <li>A advisory board can be a group of trusted folks who debate on tough issues like fund raising, product direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should never override the decision makers in the new business.</p>
