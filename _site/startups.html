    <p>Startups &amp; Advices</p>

<p>Hi there, you have reached this page because someone passed you this link to get advice on your startups or traditional business.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know my profile, please see <a href="/profile">here</a></p>

<p>I give advices for new businesses especially software business.
These are the areas I’m interested:
- How much to charge
- Technical direction and project management
- How to survive the first 4 years of your new business
- Ruby, Rails, iOS and other softwares that you need for productivity
- How to hire in asia
- How to do onboarding on your webapp
- Introverts - how to survive talking to extroverts
- How to and where to get a lot of data to start off
- How to succeed before you even start your new business</p>

<p>How can I value-add to your strategy and new business?
- I can connect you to the right business person
- I can recommend a developer
- I can train your developers</p>

<p>Expectation and how much should I charge?
- If you receive this link and is a new business, there is no charges to engage me except that I hope to receive 0.5% as equity and be on your advisory board.</p>

<p>This is not a request but this is an expectation. It is a fixed rate and over the years I stop taking more than 0.5 person.</p>

<p>What is an Advisory Board?
- A advisory board can be a group of trusted folks who debate on tough issues like fund raising, product direction.</p>

<p>It should never override the decision makers in the new business.</p>
