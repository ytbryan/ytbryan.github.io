<p>In this interview, I write to <a href="https://github.com/meiwin">Meiwin Fu</a> about his latest project – Clara, Personal Finance Tracker. You can get Clara at app store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clara-personal-finance-for/id816875421?ls=1&amp;mt=8">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/meiwin">Meiwin</a> is one of the best iOS developers in Singapore whose work I follow closely.</p>

<p><strong>0. Let’s start with a short introduction. Who are you?</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I am Meiwin Fu. I am a software engineer with 10 years mileage. I am currently working at a small startup in Singapore, building software product for the enterprise.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is Clara?</strong></p>

<p>Clara is iPhone/iPod Touch app for tracking personal finances (expenses and incomes). It’s a personal project of mine.</p>

<p><a href="http://ytbryan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_512.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1388" alt="clara_512" src="http://ytbryan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_512.png" width="512" height="512" /></a></p>

<p><strong>2. What is the reason for starting Clara?</strong></p>

<p>Clara is not really a new project, I built similar apps in the past that do the same (GotExpenses, then Piggie). Both apps are no longer maintained, one of them has been pulled from App Store long ago.</p>

<p>I started Clara as a replacement app to Piggie.</p>

<p><strong>3.When was Clara Launched?</strong></p>

<p>Clara is launching on 20 February 2014.</p>

<p><strong>4. How was it launched?</strong></p>

<p>No specific marketing effort really, just slowly building up awareness via Facebook page and telling friends.</p>

<p><strong>5. What motivates you to be doing Clara?</strong></p>

<p>I build Clara for myself to answer simple question: ‘Where does my money go? Am I spending too much? Do I save enough money?’.</p>

<p>Piggie was built for the same motivation. Ever since I stop working on Piggie, I tried to find good replacement but never did successfully.</p>

<p>So I decided to start fresh, and I build Clara as the result.</p>

<p><strong>6. Where do you get your design inspiration from?</strong></p>

<p>There are few apps where Clara draw its inspiration from, some could be pretty obvious.</p>

<p>For example, the navigation tab bar is design from a popular twitter client, Tweetbot.</p>

<p>The typeface used is Avenir. <del>heavily used by app called Vesper. (Edited: A common friend told meiwin and I that Vesper is using typeface Ideal Sans:)<br /> </del></p>

<p>You may also find the swiping-right navigation familiar, I first saw this design used in Simplenote app.</p>

<p>Then the animated amount input is inspired by Square Cash app.</p>

<p>Lastly, you would see in the main view of the app, the summary details stick to the top as you pull down.</p>

<p>This is the same design used by Apple’s own app store app.</p>

<p>So there you are, the 5 apps that inspire Clara’s design.</p>

<p>And for how the app works and other small details, they are coming from experience building and using similar apps myself.</p>

<p><strong>7. How long did you spend to create the initial prototype?</strong></p>

<p>I started the idea of building Clara around August/September 2013.</p>

<p>At first, I was experimenting with a new idea/approach for tracking money. It took 3 months to design and build.</p>

<p>But it was later scrapped because I realized it doesn’t work (after using it myself for sometime).</p>

<p>So I started again from beginning. It takes me another 3-4 months to design and develop the current Clara.</p>

<p>Since this my personal project, I can only afford to spend very limited hours per week.</p>

<p>The fact is that I am also splitting the available times between family and working on Clara.</p>

<p>I think I spend an average of 10 hours per week.</p>

<p>Between design (prototyping on paper/Sketch app) and development, the ratio is around 40:60.</p>

<p><strong>8. What can we expect from Clara?</strong></p>

<p>There are few things I have in mind, such as iPad version, iCloud syncing, multiple vaults, PDF reporting, etc.</p>

<p>But I have not decided any.</p>

<p>For the near future, I will focus primarily on app stability and minor tweaks.</p>

<p>I will gather initial feedbacks from users to help decide what to work on next.</p>

<p><strong>9. What features can we expect from Clara?</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 important features I am looking for in a personal finance app:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tracking expenses and incomes is not a fun thing to do (unlike playing game like Flappy Bird). Because of that, the data entry must be effortless so it wouldn’t discourage you from doing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be flexible when it comes to categorizing records. Apps that fix on categories or has complicated step to create a category is a no-no.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be simple, but not simplistic. Hence it should provide basic analysis tool.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You could expect 1 and 2 to be in Clara. As for 3, Clara could be little complicated for new users. I just can’t make it simpler.</p>

<p><strong>10. How much are you charging for Clara?</strong></p>

<p>Clara will be selling at US$3.99 (or S$4.58).</p>

<p>For the launching, I’ll be running limited 3-days promo at 50% OFF.</p>

<p><strong>11. How can we contact Clara?</strong></p>

<p>You could send email to claraapp [at] blockthirty.com</p>

<p><strong>12. Where can we find you (and also clara) online?</strong></p>

<p>Facebook: <a href="http://fb.com/theclaraapp">http://fb.com/theclaraapp</a></p>

<p>Website: <a href="http://clara.blockthirty.com">http://clara.blockthirty.com</a></p>

<p><strong>13. Why do you name the app Clara?</strong></p>

<p>I named Clara after my daughter’s middle name. I wanted to name it Clarity at the beginning.</p>
