This article is written because I spend a considerable amount of time repeating myself about my experience.

<h3 id="what-is-autism">What is Autism?</h3>
<p> I am hardly an autistic expert and also have no kids who are autistic.   Most of the things I write here, is based on my research, my interaction with the children and my personal observation.</p>

<p>Autism is a range of neuro-developmental disorder. It is a range because some children have badly affected while the others are mildly affected.</p>

<p>These disorder manifests itself in the form of impairment in social interaction, communication, restrictive behaviour and repetitive behaviour. This disorder is a life-long illness.</p>

<p>The full name of autism is Autism Spectrum Disorder (aka ASD)</p>

<p>Also, there are other groups of disorder like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Global Delay (GD). But I am not going to write about them here.</p>

<p>While these children have a certain characteristic, I would say deep down, they are the same. They are children.</p>

<h3 id="now">Now</h3>

<p>I am currently serving at a Christian ministry dedicated to autistics and special needs children under Faith Methodist Church at ACJC. The worship session usually takes 1 - 2 hours every Sunday.</p>

<p>While I am there, I am a befriender, a caregiver, a teacher. So I usually spend time to talk to them about their week for older kids. For younger kids, I act as a teacher or a big brother.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, I also spend time to prepare homework/lessons for them to take home.</p>

<p>Other than the big three roles, I think most of my work revolve around being a coordinator and also their ambassador to raise awareness of their presence.</p>

<h3 id="why-volunteer">Why volunteer?</h3>

<p>I think the answer lies with yourself because everyone serve and volunteer for a different reason.</p>

<p>For me, I discover that these children gave me more than I ever put in. The number of life lessons, simple realisation, the joy of giving are things that are difficult to quantify.</p>

<p>But more importantly, anyone who wish to volunteer, should have a heart to serve first. A heart to serve starts with giving and continue on with a joy of giving.</p>

<p>Hence, do not generalise autistic children to a certain severity based on the video you watched above.</p>
