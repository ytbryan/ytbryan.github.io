Models &#8211; anything that interact with database

Models Concerns &#8211; found in controllers are modules for controllers. Place any repeatable models code here.

Use asset pipeline to arrange the javascript dependencies. First, drop your javascript into assets/javascript/<folder>. Then go to application.js to include the dependencies if you need the order to be sorted.

If your javascript depends on certain javascript to be loaded first, simply go to application.js and add //=require <relative\_path>/<name\_of\_js\_omit_.js>
