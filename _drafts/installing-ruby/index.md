1.Identify the machine/computer you are using. This tutorial is tested on a macbook running mac os X. 

2. Install rbenv.  
Why not rvm? It&#8217;s simply development. You can certainly install ruby without rbenv but I find it less troublesome. 

3. Install some gems 

4. Test it 

5. Bonus. Install a web app using Rails to test your ruby installation.
