Here are the five things that I ask myself when I review a software project and before I take it up. 

**1. Expectation level of a project. **  
Is the client asking for a rocket launcher but only has a budget for a single page website and a timeline less than the one tenth of the first trimester of a pregnancy? 

To seek low expectation is ridiculous. Not everyday is a good day and customers don&#8217;t walk into your door and say take my money! Instead, ask yourself, can I manage this expectation? 

Usually, I will try to balance the expectation by giving advices on the project requirement, project resources and timeline. 

**2. Resources available for this project. **  
This is usually known as budget. But resources known as time, equipment, availability of other programmers. 

Amount of resources is a set of variables and never a single entitles like budget. 

**3. Referral. Is this client referred by someone? **  
Next question, do I trust the referrer? Trust is relative. But it boils down to did this referrer recommend someone decent the last time? Successful projects from one referrer always help. 

I find that word of mouth is highly effective. 

**4. Communication **  
Did the client commmunicate his/her project requirement clearly? Is there a discrepency between what is convey and what is required? Commmunication can save you tons of meeting time, unnecessary travelling and unnecessary code. 

**5. Surprise surprise. Level of Asshole-ness.**  
We all love to work with nice people. There is a myth that nice people don&#8217;t get things done.  
When things don&#8217;t get done, there&#8217;s usually many reasons. Being nice is usually a strength, not a weakness. LOA affects more than just the project. Time is required to get things done and in a life time, only a few projects are successfully created. 

I don&#8217;t want to waste time. Time is too precious working on projects with asshole. I have worked in some and the only thing I learnt from those projects, are to never go back again. 

What are the
