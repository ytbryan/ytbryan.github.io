![Complicated][1]


If it's complicated, you probably shouldn't do it.

If it's too complex, don't do it first.

I have been following this mantra for years. If it’s complicated, don’t do it.

This does not mean I don’t attempt to do complicated things.

But at one point in time, I will go, “ah this is too complicated. Let’s move on.”

Adding complexity to a small business, is a sure-way to not survive this capitalist world.

It doesn’t mean I won’t try to do it.

But I give up as soon as I figure out the complexity of everything.

Complication is not necessary and it is not a foolproof as a barrier of entry to others entering the market.

There are other better barrier of entries that you can build up.

So, go for the easy and low hanging fruits first.

Try all the things but it’s complicated, abandon it. Running a small business don’t need to be difficult.

If you wish to run
