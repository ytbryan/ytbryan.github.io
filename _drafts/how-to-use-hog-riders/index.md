**1. How to deploy your hog riders? **

&#8211; tap them out with more than one finger.

&#8211; from the direction where there is the most defense.

**2. How to sustain your hog riders?**

&#8211; Hog riders require heal and rage spell.

&#8211; Use heal spell when they are down with 20% of heal.

&#8211; Use rage spell when you are dealing with heavy defense like x-bow.

Note: Hogs seldom can take down two inferno towers. Do not try this during war.
