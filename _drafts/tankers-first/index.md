Do you know that you need to deploy tankers first before deploying high damage troops?

Example of tankers are giants, golems, dragon, barb king. Basically any troop with high HP.

Example of high damage troops are wizard, archer queen.

<mark> If you deploy high damage troops without tankers, you are simply sending troops to death. </mark>
