1. It is the only flying troops that target defense towers. 

2. Combine it with minions. Because minions always win canons. 

3. Deploys in one line. 

4. Use with dragons. Because dragons has one of the highest level of health point in the game. 

5. Good for clearing air bombs. 

6. Use it for farming. For villages with lots of crossed wall, it&#8217;s better than wall breaker and giants.
