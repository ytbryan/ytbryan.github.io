The Amazing Digital Asia has been up since 2011(ish). And I keep track on the queries I get over time.

One of the top questions is "do you think I should start a venture?" and I always affectionally and firmly say "no"

Here are some reasons why you should not start a new venture or affectionaly known as a startup.

1. You wish to be your own boss. (Personally, I lol-ed whenever someone told me this is her/his reason to be doing a business)
> When you have your employees, they are your bosses. Except that you pay them to work for you. PERIOD. When you have clients, they are your ......
you get what I mean :)

2. You think that you will earn a quick buck. And you really wish your 3 year exit plan will work out.
> You won't. That is based on the data collected.

3. You already have a business plan and won some business competition.
> Business plan is the worst lie out of the business school.
If your business consultant ask you to create a business plan, ask him/her to graduate from the school now. Like now because they haven't graduate yet.

4. You do not plan to monetize and you think that you can be the next
___________.
> Yup. Read #2 and #3. Unicorn don't exist, no matter how many tech media talk about it.

4. A) But Facebook, Twitter, SpaceX, Tesla made it.
> Ok, Please do it. I would really like to see you do your next startup!

5. You know so-so and you will raised X and Y time.
> This is the best part of entrepreneurship. It's the best man win. And it's the strongest survive. If you are from a rich family, go ahead and pick your lobster. Entrepreneurship isn't your only options anyway. Then again, I cannot understand why you will pick hardship over leisure like travelling around the world and working remotely.

Then you might ask: okay those are not the reasons then what is the reason?

And for that, I have to tell you, kid. If you do not have a reason to start a business, then why are you starting a business in the first place?

Frankly, starting a business is the easiest of all during the journey. If you are stumbled onto the first question already. Then maybe you shouldn't start it in the first place.

I hope you find these thoughts useful. Let me know in the comment below. I would love to hear your thoughts.
