Use your best troops for clan war.

Best troops refer to those you use frequently and know how they will move, how you will end the game and possibly how you will achieve 3 stars.

It is a misconception that best troops means most expensive troops.

If you are trying out the first time ( or second or third time), do not use them for clan war.

If you are not familiar with the troops, do not use them for clan war. Use only the best and familiar troops for clan war.
