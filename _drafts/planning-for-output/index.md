In the real world, we always plan for the activity like &#8220;let&#8217;s practice the piano for an hour.&#8221; or &#8220;let&#8217;s train for the basketball match for two hours&#8221;

This is not good for getting things done on projects.

Instead plan for the output. Tell us what are you going to get done. Tell me which component you will finish by end of today.
