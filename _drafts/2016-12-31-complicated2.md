A fisherman don’t limit its catch.

A fisherman don’t cast a small net and thinking that it will be sufficient for the entire month.

In business, we cast a wide net. But often time, product owners face the struggle that by casting a wider net, we are forgo our initial precious net that gotten us our first catch.

We are forgoing that initial moment of joy of getting our first catch. That first cast that certified you as a fisherman.

Business strategy is different from product design and identity. Don’t get me wrong, product design and brand identity are important.

My point is, cast a wide net and keep your brand identity. They can be done.

If the business strategy causes brand identity to fade, be sure to stop that lousy strategy immediately. But if you can have a wide net but still retain that badge of fisherman and that moment of joy of casting that net, by all means, go for the new & wider net.
