Hey folks, here&#8217;s a compiled list of attack pattern that will result in 0 or 1 star in war battles.

1. Have no strategy to take down town hall or did not attack from the shortest distance to town hall.

2. Attack with not enough tankers or did not have enough damage dealer to clear the path. If your wall-breakers did not break wall, it falls under this category too.

3. Did not bring the right troops combination.

4. Be overconfidence and attack too difficult. Did not consider 1, 2 and 3 and attack a base above ceiling base.

5. Surprise surprise. Attacking in 3G and unstable network. Or attack on a bus or vehicle where it&#8217;s not stable and calm.
