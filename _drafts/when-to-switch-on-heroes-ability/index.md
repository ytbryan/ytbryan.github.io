One common misuse of hero&#8217;s ability is to use it immediate after you deploy your hero. Do not do it.

Use your hero when it&#8217;s health point is slightly lowered. This is because its ability can heal part of its health depending on its level. This allows your heroes to stay in the game longer, dealing damages. :)
