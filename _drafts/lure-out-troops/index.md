#### ***Which troop to use?***

barb or giant or wallbreaker or hog rider or minion or archer.

#### ***Steps:***

1. Find out the parameter of clan castle. During scouting (or first 30secs), tap on opponent&#8217;s clan castle to find out the parameter of the clan castle.  
2. To draw out the troops, drop a unit of troops within the parameter of opponent&#8217;s clan castle.

3. Do it a few times. You need to do this a few times to ensure the clan castle is empty.

4. If the parameter is out of reach, use a hog rider. Sometimes you need more than one hog rider to draw out all the troops.  
If you don&#8217;t have a hog rider, use one or two giants with wall breakers. It&#8217;s better to have a few giants dead than all troops destroyed.
