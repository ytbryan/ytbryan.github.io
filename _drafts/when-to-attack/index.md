It can be frustrating to decide when to attack during the clan war especially [when we are not winning][1].

These are the general rules:  
0. In clan wars, only stars matter.  
1. Attack a base that you are confident.  
2. Check if this opponent is tough by asking on the clan chat.  
3. Pick a timing that you are comfortable with. Some folks like morning. While others like evening. Pick a time.  
4. Find a comfortable place to attack.
