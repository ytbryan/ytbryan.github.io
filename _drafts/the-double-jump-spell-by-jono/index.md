If the walls are too thick, please consider using 2x jump spell and bring no wallbreakers. Your main objective is to use double jump spell to lead the troops to the town hall.

Do not break any walls because your surrounding troops will automatically follow the jump spell path.

This way, you allows those thick walls to prevent your troops from wandering around.
