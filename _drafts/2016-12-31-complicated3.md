I know it’s going against the society teaching that I am asking you to give up when it is difficult.

The society has brought us up to be resilient. To be tough. To persist when things are tough because tough times don’t last but tough humans do.

But product development and management are different. When you are creating something new, you need to abandon that branch that is growing for the sake of

You ought to stop trying when things are difficult.

You ought to open up your senses to feel the feedback. Is it working? Which features are making profit? Is the user experience good enough? What needs to be improved?

Giving up is the right thing and only thing you have to do, to make progress.

Give up today. Changes is the only constant that we all know.
