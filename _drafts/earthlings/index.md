Hey folks, you are reading this because someone think you are talented and want to invite you to our clan.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">`We are looking for talented COC players to join our weekly war at Singapore/Malaysia Time: 12pm, FRIDAY. </span>  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> We are recruiting part-time and full-time clan mates of town hall 7 &#8211; 10. With level 80 and above.`<br /> </span>  
**1. What is a part-time clan mate? **  
&#8211; oh yes, you don&#8217;t need to join us full time. Just appear for our Friday war at Singapore time 12pm and we will be best friend forever. Usual clan rules apply.

**2. Can I join/leave the clan anytime? **

&#8211; Yes. Even though we prefer long time commitment but feel free to make earthlings your second home.

**3. How to find earthlings?  
**&#8211; You can search for \`earthlings\`.  
&#8211; Or you can search #Q8L99UU

**4. You are from country X. Can you join the clan? **  
Yes you can join our clan. We do not discriminate any country/race/gender. But we take clan war attacks seriously.

**5. I tried to enter your clan but got rejected.  
**We reject players because the clan requirement is not met (level 80++ th7++) or due to poor management of village. **  
**[Read our guide to improve yourself][1] and try again next time.
