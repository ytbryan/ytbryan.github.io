Hi, I am Bryan Lim. I am currently running a singapore-based and small software firm called The Amazing Digital Asia (www.tada.asia).

I do `ruby`, `rails`, `iOS` and basically make custom and enterprise software for small and medium companies.

Currently, I'm consulting Changi Airport Group on Business Analytics project. I consulted A*STAR i2R on social media mining. I conducted `a making software with ruby and rails` class at Georgetown with The Coding Shophouse. Ex-A*STAR, Ex-Smartbear, SOC-alumni, NOC-alumni.

I have worked in Sweden, Malaysia, Singapore.

Areas where I can help out:
`ruby`, `rails`, `iOS/Objective-c/swift`, `javascript/coffeescript`

Open Source:
`aka` - http://github.com/ytbryan/aka
