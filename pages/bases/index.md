Safety base has helped us gain extra stars during the last few minutes. It is that last enemy base that we leave untouched till the very end.

But recently, we have grown up a little.

\`Introducing Ceiling Base\`.

Ceiling base will be announced together with safety base, to prevent people from attacking above ceiling base during the first few hours of the war.

It is that base that says &#8220;hey, if you are attacking bases above ceiling base (for 1st attack), you better be able to achieve two stars&#8221;

1. Ceiling base is created for clanmates with TH10/TH9.  
2. Ceiling base is created to ensure that the clanmates (especially the top players) have a good first attack. i.e. attack below ceiling base.    
3. Ceiling base is created to ensure we get more stars and avoid zero star first attack.

If you have questions, ask away in the clan! Thank you!
