There is work and there is life&#8217;s work.

The kind of work that has your fingerprint all over it. The kind of work that you would never compromise on. That you would sacrifice a weekend for. You can do that kind of work at Apple. People don&#8217;t come here to play safe. They come here to swim in the deep end. They want their work to add up to something.

Something big. Something big that cannot happen else where.

ï£¿ Welcome to Apple.
