Let&#8217;s face it, we are fighting a war together, not alone.

Here are some expectations for our weekly war:

1. Use your best troops.

2. Use both your attacks.

3. Â Set a good war layout. Note: do not use farming layout

4. Work as a team. Do not aim for loot first.

5. You should attack the correct bases. Not the recommended base.

Some folks attack bases that they will not attain 3 stars.

6. Aim for town hall first. Pick a right direction of attack. Then aim for 50% of destruction. Then aim for 100% of destruction.

7. Last and most importantly, be nice and have fun.

8. If we are not leading, focus and read this.
