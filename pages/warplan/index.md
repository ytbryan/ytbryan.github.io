#### <mark>**1. Do NOT attack the opponent&#8217;s last base.**</mark>

&#8211; We might need the safety base to win the war.

#### **<mark>2. Secure three stars with your first attack.</mark>**

&#8211; Choose an easy base for first attack.

#### **<mark>3. Always lure out the clan castle defense before deploying all of your attacking troops.</mark>**

*&#8211; Read [lure the clan castle during attack][1]*

#### **<mark>4. Looting during war is NOT ALLOWED.</mark>**

*&#8211; But if the clan is clearly winning and we are at last hour, you may loot. Ask a co-leader.*

#### **<mark>5 We aren&#8217;t winning yet.</mark>**

*&#8211; We have seen cases when we lead by 20 stars in the beginning, and end up losing with 2 stars. *

#### **<mark>6. Always have fun and have lots of fun :) </mark>**

&#8211; We will and we can! Go for the win, Earthlings!
