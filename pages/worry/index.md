Once in a while, it is a good reminder that worry helps us with nothing.

Our time is limited and don&#8217;t waste time worrying about the future, about the tomorrow orÂ the others.

To counter worry, choose action. Do something, do anything. Say a little prayer, do something that you like to do, read a book,take your mind off the object of worrisome.
