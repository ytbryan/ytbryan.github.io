Do you know that once your tankers get hit by a defense tower, the defense tower will &#8220;lock on&#8221; the tanker till it is dead?

<mark>You can use this to your advantage by sending high number of tankers or single super-tanker (e.g golem or high-level barb king). Complement this with high damage troops like wizards to clear the base. </mark>

Good Luck folks.
