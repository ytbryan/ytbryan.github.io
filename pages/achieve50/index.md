This is a draft for the clan war battle&#8217;s attack strategy.

1. Drop archers or minions (or even barb) at blind spots or unprotected structures. 

2. Aim for shortest distance to enemy&#8217;s town hall. 

2a. Deploy tankers first. 

2b. Deploy high damage dealers. 

3a. Clear the path for your tankers and damage dealers.
