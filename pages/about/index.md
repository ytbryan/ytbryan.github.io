My name is Bryan Lim. I write short posts which take a minute to read.

I&#8217;m an independent programmer and founder of The Amazing Digital Asia, currently based in Singapore. I am also a student at NUS Business School. I run [Shoppink][1] and [Monday][2] as my day job and do iOS and Rails consulting for companies. You can hire me <a title="Hire Me" href="/hire-me" target="_blank">here</a>.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The preferred way to reach me is on twitter </span><a style="line-height: 1.6;" href="https://twitter.com/ytbryan">@ytbryan</a> or send me an email. I will take longer to reply on other medium.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@ytbryan">Ask me a quick question on twitter</a> </span> or [email me][3]
