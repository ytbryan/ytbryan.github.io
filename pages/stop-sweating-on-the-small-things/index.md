A few years back, I realise that I am running out of time doing the things I like. I decided not toÂ sweat on the small things a few years back when I find that I do not have time to finish the things I like to do.

There&#8217;s only so much time in the world and don&#8217;t waste them on doing things that you do not like.

Your time is limited and don&#8217;t waste them on the small things.
