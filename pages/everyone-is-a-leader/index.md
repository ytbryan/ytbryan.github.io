It is intended that everyone is a leader in this clan. This means that everyone&#8217;s opinion will be treasured.

As for the eldership, everyone will be elder and above.

C0-leaders will be given out if you show awesome attack skill and donationship.

COC is a team effort. Leader-leader model makes more sense than leader-follower model.

So feel free to share your thoughts.
