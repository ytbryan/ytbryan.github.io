If you are reading this, we are probably not be leading in a clan war yet. What should you do? 

<mark>0. First thing first, stay calm!</mark>  
&#8211; We probably went through these many times. Everyone wants to win. Let&#8217;s aim to win by one star!

<mark>1. Ask for advice on the clan channel. Who are you going to attack? Tell us!</mark>  
&#8211; Say it out so that others can comment. Say it out so that the others can strategise too. 

<mark>2. Make sure you use BOTH attacks.</mark>  
&#8211; Don&#8217;t give up. Aim for the stars. Do not aim for loot 

<mark>3. Use best troops. Do not use barbs or archers. Bring the big guns like wiz.</mark>  
&#8211; War is not like casual attack. The stars will add to your profile. Each win will add to clan&#8217;s glory. 

<mark>4. Request for the best troops.</mark>  
&#8211; Don&#8217;t bring too many barbs or archers. 

<mark>5. Bring all your spells.</mark> 

<mark>6. Before attack, check opponent&#8217;s clan castle&#8217;s perimeter and troop count. Estimate the hidden teslas position.</mark>  
&#8211; Decide which direction to attack. Have a strategy plan. 

<mark>7. Have fun</mark>  
&#8211; It&#8217;s just a game. :)
