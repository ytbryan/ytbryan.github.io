Clan war is messy because it involves many players. These are some errors/mistakes that players make. Identifying them will help to avoid them. :) 

1. Over-confident. Attacking bases beyond your ability. These happen more often.  
2. Under-confident. Attacking bases below your ability.  
3. Fail to clear clan castle troops. Hence, a wipe out of your tankers.  
4. Fail to attack at the right direction. Hence, fail to hit town hall. Hence fail to achieve at least two stars.  
5. Fail to scout and plan your attack. Hence, result in a messy attack which ends with no stars.  
6. Fail to bring your best troops.
