title: Permanent Aliases, Terminal Shortcuts and Plenty of Productivity

Aliases are Terminal Shortcuts. And I use aliases to improve my productivity across all my projects.

Currently there&#8217;s no way to generate aliases without opening the text editor. Save it. And source the dot file.

And these step are repetitive. And somewhat redundent. So I started making a script that help me do that manually via the terminal.
