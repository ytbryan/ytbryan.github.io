Now, there are school of thoughts like TDD, BDD. And they are good places to find out more about tests.

But I think that tests are good enough to guard your codes from failing to deliver.

If you are paid to do a project, your tests are only as good as your codes. Spend more time writing codes than you did on tests.

Don&#8217;t fall into a cult following habits. It&#8217;s better to hone on your programming skill than to write codes for tests.
