Which part of the day do you get the most work done? For me, it&#8217;s the dawn of a new day.

I have been waking up at around 4am &#8211; 6am to enjoy my undisrupted hours of work till 9am.

I usually focus on creation work or completing a long list of mini-tasks during these hours.

Indirectly, this habit enforces me to sleep early and go back home earlier.

Working earlier does not mean working longer.Â Your body is not designed to work for long hours with no side effect.

After all, sleep deprivation is never a badge of honor &#8211; [signalvnoise][1].

PS: Waking up early probably does not work for everybody, especially the night owls. Adjust your timing accordingly.

So, which part of the day do you get the most work done?
