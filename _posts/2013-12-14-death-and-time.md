There are two things that don&#8217;t lie: Death and Time.

When you know you are dying, your priorities and thoughts become clearer. Procrastination disappears. To-do list becomes shorter. Unimportant things become unimportant.

Wrote a poem or an article? Come back to it after two weeks. It will become clearer which part Â of the writing needs a rewrite. Time is your best friend here.

In front of Death and Time, things only get clearer.
