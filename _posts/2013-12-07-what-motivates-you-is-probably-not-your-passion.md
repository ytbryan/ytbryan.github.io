Passion is not the true motivation of one’s life.

Passion is the result of continuously doing what you want or love to do.

It is the result of your drive and motivation.

The answer to what drives and motivates you is more important than finding what you are passionate about.

You probably already know what you want or love to do. But didn’t have the courage to do it.Find the drive and motivation of your life, not passion.
