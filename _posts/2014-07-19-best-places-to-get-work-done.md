In my opinion, these are the best places to get work done.

1. My apartment&#8217;s room  
2. Coffeeshop with my mobile broadband  
3. Library  
4. Church  
5. Schools or University  
6. My ex-company&#8217;s office  
7. Any quiet corners with wifi available

It&#8217;s not the office but the people and their actions that disrupt work.

As long as the place has few distractions and has internet access, I&#8217;m happy to sit down and get some work done.

I also find it [a mistake to take longer to travel to your favourite spot][1] just to get work done. Remote work should reduce travelling as much as possible. It&#8217;s the work that is important here.
