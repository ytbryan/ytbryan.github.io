First,Â [you need to be able to find good programmers.][1]

Next, you need to have both trust and good communication in your workplace.

Then, your remote programmers require discipline.

And last but not least, you need to judge the remote programmers&#8217; work based on work itself.

Can you or your company's leaders do these to enable remote working?
