<span style="line-height: 1.5;">How often do you get disrupted by last minute changes? Or arrange a meet-up that did not happen?</span>

To overcome this,  I  send<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> a short email/sms/message to the client, hours before the actual meeting. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>

eg. &#8220;See you at 1pm later&#8221;

This lowers the chances of miscommunication. If there are any last-minute changes, you will be informed through the reply.`<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;"> </span>`
