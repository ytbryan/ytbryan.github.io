Oh that single perfect distraction free place for remote work.

The worst myth of remote work is that you need a different (perfect) place outside office to get the most work done, every single day.

There are several places outside of your office with few or no distractions. Like [these places. ][1]

But if you spend more time in your day finding that perfect place instead of actually working, you are working (remotely) wrongly .

Remote work is about productivity. Stick to one spot and get work done.
