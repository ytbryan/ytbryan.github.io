According to some economists, consumers with low elasticity of demand should be charged at a higher price.

While the consumers with high elasticity of demand should be charged at a low price.

A better question is, how do you determine of the elasticity of demand for your product? And how do you determine the willingness to pay for a product or service? 

Adjusting your pricing by measuring and testing the willingness to pay of your customers, is a simple rule to setting a pricing. Start with how much are you, willing to pay for your own service. Adjust until you get the right willingness.
