The problem with making a product from a minimal viable product (MVP) point of view, is the belief that, by making something minimal/lesser, one can effectively test the market and get a viable testing result.

A MVP attracts Minimal Viable Feedback (MVF).

Instead of aiming for MVP, makers should understand the problem set and give a useful solution.

When a product is useful, people use it. When a useful product is made, people switch to it.

So what is a viable product? It is a useful product.

How do you define a minimal useful product? I am not sure.

When you compromise on a product, you usually end up paying somewhere down the road.
